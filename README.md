I recently got into Clojure thanks to [this awesome book](https://www.braveclojure.com/do-things/). However, I am far from being able to go through it, so I decided to keep working on common problems and see where Clojure shines.

This is a 99-problems listing inspired by the [Prolog-99 Problems](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/).
